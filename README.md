# Olympic Games Analysis

## Introduction 

These are two group projects that analyze data on the modern Olympics from the first modern Olympic Game in 1986 to Rio 2016. In the first project we conducted some descriptive statistics analysis, EDA, and some tests, uch as ANOVA and Chi-Squared Test. In the second project, we used various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to make predictions and discover, visualize, and explore patterns in the Olympics dataset.
