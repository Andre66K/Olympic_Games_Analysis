# Olympic Games Analysis

## Introduction 

These are two group projects that analyze data on the modern Olympics from the first modern Olympic Game in 1986 to Rio 2016. In the first project we conducted some descriptive statistics analysis, EDA, and some statistical tests, such as ANOVA and Chi-Squared Test, to infer insightful conclusions. In the second project, we used various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to make predictions and discover, visualize, and explore patterns in the Olympics dataset. 

## Project Description

I performed this project as part of a group for my Introduction to Data Science class at The George Washington University. The requirements for the first project were to perform exploratory data analysis and use different types of inferential statistics on a complex dataset of our choice using R. The requirements for the second project were to build models using supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms in order to make predictions and gain meaningful insights from the dataset. We could decide whether to keep the same dataset or change it.

## Data Source 

The Olympic Games dataset is a historical dataset that contains data from Athens 1886 to Rio 2016. The dataset was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) and originally scrapped from sports-reference.com in May 2018. The dataset consists of 27116 observations and 15 columns, which include information on the athletes such as their sex, age, and weight.
